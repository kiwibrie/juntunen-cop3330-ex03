 Exercise 3 - Printing Quotes
 Quotation marks are often used to denote the start and
 end of a string. But sometimes we need to print out the
 quotation marks themselves by using escape characters.

 Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.
 Display the quotation and author as shown in the example output.

 Example Output
 What is the quote? These aren't the droids you're looking for.
 Who said it? Obi-Wan Kenobi
 Obi-Wan Kenobi says, "These aren't the droids you're looking for."

 Constraints
 Use a single output statement to produce this output, using
 appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
 If your language supports string interpolation or string substitution,
 don’t use it for this exercise. Use string concatenation instead.

 Challenge
 Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the
 user, you create a structure that holds quotes and their associated
 attributions and then display all of the quotes using the format in
 the example. An array of maps would be a good choice.
